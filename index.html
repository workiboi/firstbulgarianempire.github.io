  <h2 class="infoH2">The First Bulgarian empire was a state that's reign took place within the 7th and 11th centuries. <br> The First Bulgarian empire followed the times of Old Bulgaria and was then followed by the second Bulgarian empire. The location of which the empire was located is eastern Europe. Bulgaria has had multiple empires such as the first and the second empires which reigned Bulgaria. This empire came to power when Khan Asparuh of Bulgaria led his bulgar tribe of 30,000 to 50,000 armed men to north eastern Balkans Peninsular in 681 C.E. By doing so Asparuh secured Byzantine (which was in command of The Eastern Roman empire) whilst Rome was unaware of Aparuhs victory they formed their army to rebel againts the bulgar tribe. When the Armies clashed Aparuh came out as the winner. This led to his claim to land which formed the first Bulgarian empire. The people of the first bulgarian empire speak Byzantine, Proto-Slavic, Bulgar, Greek and Old Bulgarian. Whilst their religions consist of the state religion which is Tengrism, Slavic Paganism and Orthadox Christianity.

<div class="infoBlock">
  <h2 class="infoH2">During the first and second decades of the foundation of the empire, the army consisted of Slavic infantry and Bulgar heavy cavalry. <br> Heavy cavalry was the main core of the army, which consisted of 12,000 to 30,000 armed horsemen. These cavalry wore plated armour and sabres. The Bulgarian army were so fierce that that roman commanders were reluctant to fight them in their home territory. Bulgaria was one of the most formidable military forces in Europe and was feared by its enemies.

  <h2 class="infoH2">According to inscriptions dated from the reign of Khan Malamir (831–836) there were three classes of people in Medieval Bulgaria: 'Boila' which roughly translated to Nobility, each boila clan had its own iconic symbol which distinguished them from other boila. The common people of Bulgaria were simply known as Bulgarians, these people worked on the land of nobles. Some owned their own business or small plot of land, most were uneducated, illiterate and unskilled. It was the smallfolk's job to procure harvest and money for themselves. Peasants had to pay taxes to the nobles, tax could sometimes be paid in crops or money. The final class is the monarchy, these people were are apart of the hierarchy. The monarch was responsible for the issues of peace and war. He was also a chief for the Bulgarian armies. The monarch of Bulgaria was Asparukh being the first and Presian II the second.

<div class="infoBlock">
  <h2 class="infoH2">Diseases were very common throughout medieval Bulgaria mainly due to lack of proper diet and poor hygiene. Some of the most common diseases were dysentery, cholera, typhoid fever, chicken pox and varying measles. People mostly caught diseases because they had very small houses and had to sleep in rooms with sheep, cows and horses. These animals were common a source of fleas and hence diseases as poor people couldn’t afford to take a bath and wash their clothes frequently. Bulgaria suffered such turmoil, in fact Bulgaria was riddled with detrimental diseases such as leprosy (or Hansens disease) and scurvy.

  <h2 class="infoH2">The first Bulgarian empire was a revolutionary time for advancements in literature, weaponry and technology. Bulgaria was also an immense foundation for its powerful predecessor, the seconds Bulgarian empire. The first empire very much shaped what Bulgaria is today. Sacral structures such as churches and monasteries were erected after the Christianisation of Bulgaria, many such structures still stand today and are tourist attractions. Another example of surviving artifacts is the art and ceramics that can be found in Bulgarian museums. Tsar’s such as Simeon II also play a role in the expansion of Bulgaria. Simeon II was renowned for his great feats of conquering lands owned by the byzantine. This obviously had a great effect to create modern day Bulgaria.
